# Zenflow 禅宗流

**Zenflow** is a Python 3 library for building and training artificial neural networks.

**From Wikipedia**:

The word **Zen** is derived from the Japanese pronunciation (kana: ぜん) of the Middle Chinese word 禅 (pinyin: Chán), which can be approximately translated as "absorption" or "meditative state".

In positive psychology, a **flow** state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.
